_**Organi**ser_ is a next-generation web framework, focused on provinding the best developing and maintenance experience, benefiting from Ecmascript's new definitions.

Our goal is having an **organi**zed and **organi**c **ser**ver. But what does that mean?

It means that you can bring complex highly scalable systems to life, with easy maintaining, without having to learn hard syntaxes. It is organized because of its well-known syntax, used in Spring Boot, for example, and it is organic because Organiser makes sense: it is just like telling the server what it should do, in almost natural-like language.
